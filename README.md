Results of experiments are published in "Margin of Victory in Tournaments: Structural and Experimental Results. Markus Brill, 
Ulrike Schmidt-Kraepelin, and Warut Suksompong. AAAI 2021, Forthcoming."

For running the code we used Python 3.7.7 and the libraries networkx 2.4, matplotlib 3.2.1, numpy 1.18.2, and pandas 1.0.3. Moreover, our script imports "generating_profiles.py" contributed by Mattei and Walsh (2013), accessible at https://github.com/PrefLib/PrefLib-Tools.
